# QuantumComputingBayesianGST

The following code is written in R and stan. Code that implements this is written in Matlab.

## Purpose 
Frequentist statistics requires Monte Carlo simulations in order to get error bars on estimates. For large and computationally difficult problems, this might require a cluster. However, this can be avoided with Bayesian statistics, which provides error bars on estimates. Rather than use MLE to perform Gate Set Tomogrpahy, this code uses Bayesian Statistics. This code is initially run using Matlab code (which cannot be posted). The Matlab code runs the R code, which implements Rstan. The results of Rstan are then fed into Matlab to complete the analysis. 

The code to generate the graphs is not able to be posted as it was part of the matlab code. 

Additionally, an example of data.temp and data.init have been posted to the github so that the file can be run. 

## Input to R

The input to R is two files temp.data and temp.init. Both are generated form the program, but data.init is more associated with initial values and data.temp is associated with constants or parameters.

### Data.Temp

measurementResults: a structure of a vector with dimensions (number of rows for each gate) x (number of gates * number of columns for each gate). It contains the number of counts observed and should equivalent to lining up the gates. 
       
    If input into R as: 
    structure(c(10, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 10, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 10, 5, 0, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 5, 0), Dim = c(4,16))
    It should be stored in R as:
    10  5  5  0  5  0  5  5  5  5  0  5  0  5  5 10
     5  0  5  5  5  5  5 10  5  5  0  5  5 10  5  5
     5  5  0  5  0  0  5  5  0  5  5 10  5  5 10  5
     0  5  5  5 10  5  5  5  5  5  0  5 10  5  5  0
